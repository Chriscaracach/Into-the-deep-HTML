## What is this??

I found myself using React at a professional level, but not knowing HTML in a deep way (neither CSS, but give me a break).

So, this is my attempt to learn HTML in a professional way.

### What I'll do?

I've created a board with 50 HTML tags. Some of them are basics, some other are more complex. Those tags are also grouped into categories.

I'll create a folder with an index.html file per each category and try to understand the tags.

My main source of researching will be MDN. And of course, for some cases, I'll use ChatGPT/Gemini.

I'll also add some comments explaining what I understood about the topic. <!---->
